# Streets on the Lake Marriage

This project was built for Cooper & Sarah's wedding! The project was built with Doug's React.js website boilerplate template ([dougs-react-boiler](https://github.com/douglasrcjames/dougs-react-boiler)) and was further bootstrapped from [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). In this setup, we have Doug's 
base CSS library, base React components (like Header & Footer), directories structured, React Router ready to go, and more!
